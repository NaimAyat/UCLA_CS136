# Lecture 18: Securing Your System
## Critical Tenets of Effective Cyber Security Defense
1. Offense informs defense
   * Keep up to date on what attacks are really occurring
   * Spend your efforts on defending against those attacks
     * Rather than against the “exciting” new attack nobody is really using
2. Prioritization
   * Invest your efforts against attacks that pose the greatest risk to you
   * Considering threat actors likely to attack you
     * And the practicalities of taking the defensive measures
3. Metrics
   * Establish security-meaningful metrics for your organization
   * That make sense to all relevant parties
     * Executives as well as technical people
   * Take actions based on what you measure
4. Continuous diagnostics and mitigation
   * Continue measuring what’s happening at all times
   * Expect to make changes in defensive mechanisms in response 
   * Validate that changes you make are effective in addressing what you measured
5. Automation
   * Automate your defenses to the extent possible
   * Also automate measurement of defenses
   * And testing of defenses
   * Vital for fast response and scalability
## Nature of Controls
### Inventory of Devices on Your System
* Why this is important: 
  * If you don’t know what you have, how can you protect it?
  * Attackers look for everything in your environment
  * Any device you ignore can be a point of entry
  * New devices, experimental devices, “temporary” devices are often problems
  * Users often attach unauthorized devices
#### Quick Win
* Install automated tools that look for devices on your network
* Active tools
  * Try to probe all your devices to see who’s there
* Passive tools
  * Analyze network traffic to find undiscovered devices
* Maintain an approved inventory of devices
### Inventory of Devices on Your System
* Why it’s important:
  * Most attacks come through software installed on your system
  * Understanding what’s there is critical to protecting it
  * Important for removing unnecessary programs, patching, etc.
* Looking for both authorized and unauthorized software
