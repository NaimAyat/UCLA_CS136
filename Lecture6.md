# Lecture 6
## Basics of Security Protocols
* Assume (usually) that your encryption is sufficiently strong
* Given that, how do you design a message exchange to achieve a given result securely?
* Not nearly as easy as you probably think
* Many of the concepts are important in many areas of computer/network security
## Security Protocols
* A series of steps involving two or more parties designed to accomplish a task with suitable security
* Sequence is important
* Cryptographic protocols use cryptography
  * Most useful protocols are cryptographic
* Different protocols assume different levels of trust between participants
