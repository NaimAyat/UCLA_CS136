# Lecture 16: Evaluating System Security
## Secure System Standards
* U.S. Orange Book
* Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation
## The U.S. Orange Book
* The earliest evaluation standard for trusted operating systems
* Defined by the Department of Defense in the late 1970s
* Now largely a historical artifact
## Purpose of the Orange Book
* To set standards by which OS security could be evaluated
* Fairly strong definitions of what features and capabilities an OS had to have to achieve certain levels 
* Allowing “head-to-head” evaluation of security of systems
  * And specification of requirements
## Why Did the Orange Book Fail?
* Expensive to use
* Didn’t meet all parties’ needs
  * Really meant for US military
  * Inflexible
* Certified products were slow to get to market
* Not clear certification meant much
* Review procedures tied to US government
## The Common Criteria
* Modern international standards for computer systems security
* Covers more than just operating systems
  * Other software (e.g., databases)
  * Hardware devices (e.g., firewalls)
* Design based on lessons learned from earlier security standards
* Lengthy documents describe the Common Criteria
## What’s the Common Criteria About?
* Highly detailed methodology for specifying :
  1. What security goals a system has
  1. What environment it operates in
  1. What mechanisms it uses to achieve its security goals
  1. Why anyone should believe it does so
## How Does It Work?
* Someone who needs a secure system specifies what security he needs
  * Using CC methodology
  * Either already defined protection profiles
  * Or he develops his own
* He then looks for products that meet that profile
  * Or asks developers to produce something that does
