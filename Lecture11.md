# Lecture 11: Intrusion Detection
## External Intrusions
* An unauthorized (usually remote) user trying to illicitly access your system
* Using various security vulnerabilities to break in
* The typical case of a hacker attack
## Internal Intrusions
* An authorized user trying to gain privileges beyond those he should have
* Used to be most common case
* No longer the majority of problems
  * But often the most serious ones
* More dangerous, because insiders have a foothold and know more
