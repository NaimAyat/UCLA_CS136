# Lecture 1
## Examples of Security Problems
* Malicious code attacks
  * Multiple new viruses, worms, botnets, trojans appear every week
  * "Cryptojacking" of everything from servers to web cams
    * To mine cryptocurrency
  * Stuxnet worm targeted at nuclear facilities
    * Unspecified amounts of damage done to Iran's nuclear program
  * Increasing attacks on the IoT
* Distributed denial of service attacks
  * Use large number of compromised machines to attack one target
    * By exploiting vulnerabilities
    * Or generating a lot of traffic
  * Very common today
    * 1 TBps attack on Github in 2018
    * 2018 attacks on online gaming companies
    * Attacks based on compromised Huawei routers
  * Difficult problem to solve
* Vulnerabilities in commonly used systems
  * Critical vulnerabilities in Android, Windows, iOS, and macOS
  * Many popular apps and middleware have vulnerabilities
    * Windows VBScript, Apache Struts, WordPress, Adobe Flash
  * Many security systems have vulnerabilities
    * libssh, Microsoft CredSSP, Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance
  * Critical hardware flaws in Intel and AMD processors
    * Fixes lead to slower processor
* Electronic commerce Attacks
  * Identity theft (phishing)
  * Loss of data from laptop theft
  * Extortion via DDoS attacks or threatened release of confidential data
  * Crypto mining on compromised machines
## Cyberwarefare
* Nation states have developed capabilities to use computer networks for such purposes
* DDoS attacks on Estonia and Georgia
* Stuxnet
* Attacks on Ukrainian power grid
## Legacy and Retrofitting
* Legacy issues are a constrain
  * Core internet design
  * Popular programming languages
  * Commercial operating systems
* Retrofitting security works poorly
  * Consider the history of patching
### Problems with Patching
* Usually done under pressure
  * Quick and dirty
* Tends to deal with immediate problem, not root cause
* Hard to get patch to everyone
* Patches sometimes intruduce new security problems
  * Microsoft 2018 Meltdown patch
## Increasing CPU Speeds
* Attacks are developed more quickly; it's faster to adapt attack than defense
* Malware spreads faster
## Security and Protection
* Security is a policy
  * "No unauthorized user may access this file"
* Protection is a mechanism
  * "The system checks user identity against access permissions"
* **Protection mechanisms implement security policies**
